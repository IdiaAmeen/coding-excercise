# GoCanvas: Coding Excercise

## Assignment

Pull data from an API and render that data in the browser. 

This can be as simple as a styled list of entries from any of the public APIs below. Don’t spend more than 2-3 hours on this. The code doesn’t need to be perfect, but you should be able to talk about the decisions you made when building it.

## Goals

The primary goal of this excercise is to provide us with code that we can discuss during the technical portion of the interview. If you already have a project that you've created that would fit the criteria please feel free to submit that instead.


## Example Public APIs
* The Star Wars API: https://swapi.dev/
* PokeAPI: [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
* OpenWeather: [Weather API - OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* Open Library: [Developer Center / APIs | Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)
* Open Brewery DB: [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/)
* Many More: [public-apis/README.md at master · public-apis/public-apis · GitHub](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis/blob/master/README.md)
